# Automated-Youtube-Player

This is python file that plays a video in vlc by using a keyword entered by the user.
This doesn't needs to open a browser ,open youtube and search for a song
One constraint is that it plays the first result that appears due to the search

For this I have used a linux environment in this .
Python version is 3+.
Using pip install python-vlc, pafy, pyaudio, youtdl
